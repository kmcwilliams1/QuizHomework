ok this one was hard! there were a lot of moving parts going on and trying to get all the var and functions in the right spot was a nightmare. Im getting better at the syntax but some of
these commands were well outside my grasp. I wish we could study these concepts more in depth but the amount of time needed to better understand it would put me a week behind in class.
I still need to get the high scores working but local storage is by far the thing I understand the least at the moment. Tutoring has been a big help and while I understand most of 
the lines, it's knowing when to use what and how to properly call it, that's still getting me tripped up. I have a list of to-do's at the bottom of the javascript but I doubt I'll 
be able to complete them before I turn it in, especially at the pace I am working.
